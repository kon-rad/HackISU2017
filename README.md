## Inspiration
We drew our inspiration for HackerFeed from the popular social media website instagram. We wanted to capture Instagram’s simple yet powerful design that allows people to share meaningful parts of their lives with others. Since project sharing websites like github are often complicated and difficult to use, we decided to create a technology themed website that allows users to easily share and discuss the projects that they create.

## What it does
HackerFeed currently allows users to upload and describe their recently worked on software or hardware projects. Other users are able to view these projects and leave comments and likes on the project page. 

## How We built it
HTML
CSS
Javascript
NodeJS
Express
AngularJS
MongoDB
Heroku

## Challenges We ran into
When we first began the project, the first challenge we ran into was finding out which technologies/frameworks we were going to use to build our project. As we became more decisive on how we were going to build the website, our next biggest challenge was the learning curve involved with technologies we were using. Since two out of three of us had only had experience using Javascript, HTML, and CSS before starting the project, the learning curve of using the MEAN Stack was by far the largest challenge. In terms of technical challenges, we had the most issues uploading the project to Heroku and getting the login screen to work properly.

## Accomplishments that We’re proud of
The main accomplishment that we are proud of was the amount of time we used to learn about the MEAN Stack. We are also proud of not giving up on our idea and finding ways to get around the issues we encountered.

## What We learned
Some of the team learned the basics of git and how websites are structured
We all learned about the MEAN Stack and how to use it
We all learned about what it takes to build a picture sharing website

## What's next for HackerFeed
Further improve the UI of the website
Allow users to share projects to other social media websites
Create a source code link box to make it easier for users to find the code
